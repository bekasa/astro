## Search Engine Index

Search engine indexing is the process of inviting popular search engines to register and save (index) site pages.

Why is this so important? Search engines deliver relevant search results to search queries. These results link to pages and traffic derived therefrom can be regrded as 'free' in the sense that it is not directly paid for by advertising. In many cases it would not be possible to generate the volunms of traffic by using advertising as the cost would be prohibitive.


 Users making queries are usually looking for solutions to their problems and tend to look at results from the first or at most first three pages.
